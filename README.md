## Hi there 👋

<!--
**Theta1112/Theta1112** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.-->

I'm a Data Science Student currently enrolled in a Masters of Urban Spatial Analytics at the University of Pennsylvania. Currently, I'm learning new skills in spatial data analysis, public policy solutions in land use planning, and the development of cloud-native systems.
